# Cybersecurity-Professional-Statement
Ever since I was a child, I’ve been drawn to puzzles. I am driven by a deep curiosity and a 
love for uncovering hidden patterns. That passion found its academic home in my senior 
year of high school, when I took Discrete Math, which became my favorite subject. It 
challenged me to solve complex problems, follow logical leads, and spot details that tend 
to be overlooked. Today, as an adult who wants to work in cybersecurity, I’ve found the 
perfect arena to apply those same skills in the real world, in a constantly evolving digital 
landscape full of new things. I am a very goal-oriented ethical person who values order, 
honesty, and integrity.
